The branch and bound technique we used to solve the knapsack problem
resembled the exhaustive algorithm in speed. That is because the branch
and bound algorithm is essentially an exhaustive search with bounds that
may cut of a branch to save a little time and a lot of bad solutions.
The answers we got, however, were much more accurate than the exhaustive
search and even slightly more accurate than the greedy algorithm we used
for the second project. The bounds help in finding a good solution early
because we are choosing the paths most likely to have the highes values.
