For the knapsack problem, our greedy algorithms ran fast because our neighborhood
was less complex than the graph coloring, only switching 1 boolean value. None of
the random algorithms did well even though many of them were being considered.
This held true for the graph coloring problems as well although the greedy
algorithm took more time becuase we were considering changes to every node to 
every available color to see which was the best. Another reason for the length
of time was the steepest part of the steepest path. We had to go through every
neighbor before we chose a path to go down. These solutions were good though
and any algorithm can be used with the 2-opt or 3-opt neighborhoods to make
them better.
